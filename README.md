This readme is meant to be read by you.

The problem is that you are probably one of #etc's finest: forged out of the
fires of loyalty to our ~~god-king~~ good friend, yossarian. And because of
this, you already know all of the information that is forthcoming.

[Who is the yossman](http://rectilinear.xyz/i/m31c9.png)?
This, enigmatic figure that we all swear allegiance to?
He is ~~a philosopher,~~ a programmer, and a lover of club-mates. He is the
founder of #etc.

But that doesnt answer the question. Yossman, or yossarian (no more missions!)
has created this irc channel on rizon.net to talk about all sorts of things.
We ~~declared independence~~ branched from #/g/technology sometime in the summer
as #/g/etc. We then morphed into #etc when our focus became more etc than /g/
(/g/ can be found on 4chan. I don't recommend it).

The topic of #etc is as follows:
"The home of bikes, books, ska, and technology."
Notice that technology is still in there, but its not the primary focus of the
channel.

In conclusion, etc is far more than a mere social body.
We are programmers, philosophers, anime girls, shitposters, linux users,
Windows haters, sportsballers, masters, aviators, and the rest...

(nobody cares)
